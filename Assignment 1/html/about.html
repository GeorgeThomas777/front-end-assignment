                    <p>Cricket, often hailed as a gentleman's game, is a sport steeped in tradition and revered for its strategic complexity. Played on a circular field, the game involves two teams, each taking turns to bat and bowl. The batsman's artistry in facing the bowler's challenges and the bowler's skill in deceiving the batsman create a captivating spectacle. Cricket has various formats, from the timeless Test matches that span multiple days, allowing for strategic endurance, to the shorter and more explosive One Day Internationals (ODIs) and the thrilling Twenty20 (T20) format, where every ball can be a game-changer. Iconic tournaments like the Cricket World Cup and domestic leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) add a global dimension to the sport, captivating millions of fans worldwide. Cricket's unique blend of individual brilliance within a team context has produced legendary players and memorable moments, contributing to its status as one of the most widely followed and cherished sports globally.</p>
